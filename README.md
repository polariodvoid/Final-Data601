## Summary
Can we determine student performance based on a few key characteristics? This project analyzes
roughly 33 attributes of students from two different Portuguese schools to determine performance in Mathematics.
### Goals
This project explores one major goal:
1. Explore the most important attributes regarding student performance in two different Portuguese secondary
schools as well as analyze unique characteristics of students that contribute to the overall trends of student
grades in that year.
#### Motivation and Background
The Portuguese high school and university system employs a 20-point grading scale, where each
grade is given a qualitative mark of excellence. For example, “Excellent” for grades ranging between
17.5 – 20 points or “Sufficient” for grades ranging between 9.5 – 13.4. According to the UCI data set,
the current average scores held between all students of two different Portuguese schools is roughly a
10/20 total points. According to their scale, the qualitative mark for this grade would be “Sufficient”.
Within this project, I play the role of a data scientist researching study patterns in individual students
between two Portuguese high schools, Gabriel Pereira (GP) and Mousinho da Silveira (MS),
regarding the subject of Mathematics. The analysis should provide a prediction of future average
academic progress of individuals.
##### Data Details
UCI Student Performance Data Set
This dataset contains 396 entries. These entries correspond to 396 individual students from GP and
MS. Around 300 of the entries come solely from GP.
Around 30 attributes were studied regarding each individual student. Listed below are a few
examples:
Absences
Academic Failures
Parent/Child relationships
Study time
Internet
Free time
